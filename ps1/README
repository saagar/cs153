Your job for this assignment is to implement a parser and lexer,
using lex/yacc and parsing combinators. Running make in the
current directory generates 2 executables ps2yacc and ps2comb to
test the 2 approaches. Both expect a file-to-parse as an
argument.

Usage:
ps1yacc [file-to-parse]

ps1comb [file-to-parse]
